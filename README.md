# Git Cleaner
Simple JetBrains IDE plugin for deleting unneeded git branches.

It will list all branches that do not have tracking remotes and allow you to delete them.
Each deleted branch will also do a check if it's fully merged to current branch.

Current branch will not be listed.

Just use the following action: VCS > Git > Delete Old Branches.
